Analysis:

Overview:

The purpose of this analysis was to use our knowledge of deep learning to create a tool that would help the Alphabet Soup foundation select applicants with the best chance of success in their ventures. In doing so we were given a csv that contained over 34 thousand organizations that have previously received funding.

Results:

- Data Processing:
  - What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
  - What variable(s) are the features for your model?
  - What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?


- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
  - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
  - Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
  - What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
